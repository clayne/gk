# ðŸ«§ gkern: Graphics Kernel

`gkern` is a flexible, highly configurable, and extensible render engine. It's designed for both realtime and offline rendering, with a focus on robustness, performance, and ease of use. It is written in `C` so it is easy to use with other languages.

ðŸ“Œ Currently the library renders using OpenGL. I'm trying to integrate with `Metal`, `Vulkan`, `DirectX`

HISTORY: The main purpose was render [AssetKit](https://github.com/recp/assetkit) content. Then it became general purpose rendering and graphics library.

# Features:
- Similar scene data structure with COLLADA/glTF 
- Shader generator for common materials (phong, blinn, lambert, const) 
   - This generator also supports textures, shadowmaps ... all feeatures to render scene perfectly and fast
- Shader manager (currently for common profile)
- Transform caching
- Uniform location caching
- Built-in trackball
- Multi-pass rendering 
- Rendering to Texture
- Multiple Render Targets
- Textures
- State Manager / Caching
- Frustum Culling
- Configurable shadowmaps: Yes you can select which technique to use! More techniques may be supportted by time
   - Basic/Simple Shadow Maps
   - Cascaded Shadow Maps (PSSM)
- Order Independent Transparency
   - Weighted, Blended OIT
   - Some other techniques aill also be supported natively
- PBR materials
   - Metallic-Roughness Workflow
   - Specular-Glossiness Workflow
- Simple animations
- Skeletal animations
- Morph animations
- ... 
- and some built-in helpers for many common tasks and more by fetures time...

# Notes
- This library is still unshaped, wait this until AssetKit finished. 
- After finished this AssetKit and library, I'll publish documentation and update README.
- Also check [simple-collada-viewer](https://github.com/recp/simple-collada-viewer) repo to see an example to how to use this
